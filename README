Caffe2 fork by https://github.com/caffe2/caffe2.git

instructions on building caffe2 for Android and OpenGL

# note
1. for building caffe2, if dont have one, 
  1.1 offical repo 'git clone https://github.com/caffe2/caffe2.git'
  1.2 my caffe2 repo 'https://pan.baidu.com/s/1c8oopC'
2. copy my folder 'lamia_scrips' and 'tutorial_arm64_v7a' inside caffe2
3. set you ANDROID_NDK using `ANDROID_NDK = balabala` or `export ANDROID_NDK=balabala`
4. be carefule of line end symbol cause you may meet the error saying 'build_android.sh \r', solve with converting Windows(CRLF) to Unix(LF)

# build
1. cd caffe2
2. bash ./lamia_scripts/build.sh  # and library will be installed in ./install
3. bash ./lamia_scripts/mv_library.sh  # to move library installed just now to tutorial folder

#usage
3. cd tutorial_arm64_v7a
4. make  

# note
1. executable is 'intro_in_arm' which should run under an Android device with OpenGL
2. use adb to push 'intro_in_arm' to your Android device and gain the permission for running
3. intro_in_arm.{.o, .o.d} are useless, just ignore
4. on how to use OpenGL, see 'intro_gl.cc', 'intro.cc' is for cpu and replace TensorCPU as TensorCUDA to support Nvidia GPUs
5. prebuilt caffe2-opengl-android library on the baidu cloud 'https://pan.baidu.com/s/1gfdBV2b'

Hope it helps
